### Sketch Feather Icons

[Feather](https://feathericons.com/) is a collection of simply beautiful open source icons designed by [Cole Bemis](https://github.com/colebemis/feather). Each icon is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency and readability. All 250+ icons can be accessed through a library and changed out with ease. Colors can also be changed via symbol overrides. Start using Feather in your next design project and feel free to open an issue with any problems you find within the file.
